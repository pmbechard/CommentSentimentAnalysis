Serene
Sadly, I couldn't stay in the restaurant for very long. 
I would kill someone to eat here again
All other restaurants are ugly compared to this one
the food was.............. interesting, to say the least
Awful, awful, awful!
Overall, it was good. The food was fresh and delicious and the wait staff were attentive. The restaurant was a bit busy, but not too bad.
